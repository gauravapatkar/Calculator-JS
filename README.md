 This is my Calculator Project. I Developed a fully functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project includes a user-friendly interface for basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, featuring responsive design and efficient event handling for seamless user interaction.
